    <h1>Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming</h1>
    <p>
        Normally, a great code has three common features:
        <b>maintainability, dependability, and usability</b>. It should
        also be adaptable enough to be efficient even in changing environments.
        However, before coding even begins, a few prerequisites need to be
        fulfilled to provide a solid foundation on which readable code can be
        written.
    </p>

    <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
    <p>

        <strong> This is easily the most important step of all. In the absence of these,
            a code may be inefficient even if it is completed. The prerequisites
            that need to be in place for an efficient code cover matters like design
            and architecture. An important question is how development is
            structured. What is the specific purpose of the software?</strong>

    </p>

    <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
    <p>
        <i><u>Comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer</u>. Name of the
        module, purpose of the module, description of the module, original
        author, modifications <del>and authors who modified code with a description on why it was
            modified were components of an early commenting practice.</del></i>
    </p>

    <h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often,
            developers use Y<sub>1</sub> or X<sub>1</sub> as variables, and then do
            not replace them with meaningful names. To prevent this confusion and
            utter waste of time, descriptive names should be used.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
    <p>
        <em>The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain result,
            developers may use complex logic but this should be
            <strong>minimised </strong>while writing a good code. An added advantage is if the code is also suitably
            <sup>compact</sup>. More code can be viewed on a page and programmer
            keystrokes can be reduced.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>PORTABILITY</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Another feature of a good code is <u>portability</u>. If the code
            contains values referring to absolute parameters such as file names,
            URLs or IP addresses, it will not run on a host that is of a different
            design.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>TESTING</h3>
    <p>
        <em><del>Testing is</del> also a necessary part in the process of coding.
            Test cases must be planned while the code is being written, and they are
            developed while an application is coded.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h3>
    <p>
        <em>While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors throughout.
            Though it is fine for smaller programs to be debugged after they have
            been written, this becomes a bottleneck for longer programmes.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The installation
            files should be kept to a minimum and updated regularly. Unused code or
            anything that is not necessary should not be installed.</em>
