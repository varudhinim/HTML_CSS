        Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also governed by
        informal rules. Most of these rules are formulated over decades.
        Programming languages often remain in usage for longer than their founders
        expect.

    <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>

    <p>
        This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these, a code
        may be inefficient even if it is completed. The prerequisites that need to
        be in place for an efficient code covers matters like design and
        architecture. An important question is how development is structured. What
        is the specific purpose of the software? The problem that the code is
        meant to solve must be clear to the developer. What is the design of the
        individual components? Such basic requirements have to be fulfilled when a
        good code is being written.
